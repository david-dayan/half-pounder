Note about old analysis:

I ran an earlier analysis before the 2020 late-summer run samples were sequenced. 

Data, results and notebooks for this analysis are currently saved in this directory,
but to get them to run correctly they must be moved into the top directory.

Some exceptions though: in some directories there may be redundant files, directories 
labeled "2021" are the current data. For example, "./structure/halfpounder" contains
the structure results and data without the added 2020 late-summer run samples, while 
"./structure/halfpounder_2021" contains the correct most up-to-date data.
